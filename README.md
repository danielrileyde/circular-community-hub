## Circular Community Hub

## Learn More

Circular Community Hub offers a platform for sustainable labels that allows you to shop directly with the producer. You get a better price while we save packaging costs and logistics effort. Every month we order together from a different label. All products you order from us are recyclable and include digital information about ingredients, repair and recycling.

Our approach is not intended for those who want to collect classic clothes and fill their wardrobe with many unique pieces. Did you know that your clothes usually spend more than 95% of their time in your wardrobe? Resources that should not be used should be shared! We increase the value of your clothes by cleaning and sharing them when you realize that it is only lying around you. We create together and we also have together. All garments that we order together belong to all users equally and can be used at 1/4-year intervals from the hub. This is true, unless you order “unlisted”, which means that you can keep your clothes unlimited – quasi shopping, but in cheap and with an additional deposit.

Why? Because our mission is closed recycling cycles and we take over the pre-sorting for the recyclers “in-house”. Products that you buy with us should come back to us, even if you don't like them anymore. This gives us the opportunity to repair, pass it on or transfer it into pure recycling.

We use the Circularity.ID in all our products to store information “in” the textiles. This allows us to communicate transparently, what your shirt is made of and what else it has experienced. The Circularity.ID helps us to keep track of what you have just borrowed, and in the end it allows pure recycling. In this way, we increase transparency along the entire supply chain and ensure that textiles find their way back into the recycling cycle.

We want to share our knowledge of sustainable design and recycling so that we have a positive impact on the entire product manufacturing, distribution and retail sector.

We enable your support, but together we can bring about a positive change in the logistics industry and beyond. Let's act together to create a more sustainable future for all of us.
